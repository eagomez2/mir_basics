        "In this assignment you should understand and reproduce the instrument classification experiment presented in [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/MTG/MIRCourse/blob/master/notebooks/Lecture1_IntroWithACaseStudy.ipynb), and then adapt the notebook to another instrument classification task, one using the [Mridangam Stroke dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/4068196). The goal is to automatically recognize the 10 different stroke classes or the 6 different tonic classes present in the dataset (you choose), trying to obtain the best possible accuracy. For both tasks you should use the whole dataset.  \n",

        "The goal of the assignment is to understand and be able to implement all the steps involved in a typical audio-based classification problem. Thus, understanding all the steps involved in designing the experiment and making the best choices for a given task. You should briefly explain within the submitted notebook, all the decisions taken in every step of the experiment.  \n",
        "\n",
        "You can optionally add a step of feature selection. Feature selection is the removal of redundancies in features, lowering the dimensionality of the feature space. Effective feature selection can improve performance of a classifier and would lower memory and computation requirements.\n",

        "- Increase the number of classes to 8 (either use more classes from UIOWA:MIS dataset or continue with the Mridangam dataset)\n",
